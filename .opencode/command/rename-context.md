description: Rename a file based on its content and context
---

I want you to rename the file located at: $1

1. Read the content of the file at "$1".
2. Analyze the code to understand its primary purpose, class name, component name, or main export.
3. Determine the most appropriate filename based on the project's existing naming conventions (e.g., kebab-case, PascalCase, matching the main component).
4. If the current name is different from the ideal name:
   - Rename the file from "$1" to the new name.
   - Explain why you chose the new name.
5. If the current name is already correct, simply state that no change is needed.
